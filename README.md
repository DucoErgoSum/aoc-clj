Each directory is a leiningen app project.

In stall [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org) following the instructions on the website.

The easiest way to get the result for a specific challenge is to enter the project directory.

Run

    lein repl

In the repl you'll be able to use functions defined in the src code, including -main.

A typical function call might look like:

    (-main 1)

Where main is the entry point for the program and the number '1' is an arbitary parameter being passed in.
